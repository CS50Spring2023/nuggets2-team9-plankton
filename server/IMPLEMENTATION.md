# CS50 Nuggets
## Implementation Spec
### Team 9: Plankton, 23S, 2023

> This **template** includes some gray text meant to explain how to use the template; delete all of them in your document!

According to the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the Nuggets game requires two standalone programs: a client and a server. As a team of 3, we designed and implemented the server program and used a predesigned client for testing.
Outside of server, our design also includes the `grid` module, which handles the client and global grids, and the `game` module, which handles initializing, updating, and ending the game.
We describe each program and module separately.
We do not describe the `support` library nor the modules that enable features that go beyond the spec.
We avoid repeating information that is provided in the requirements spec.

## Plan for division of labor

> Update your plan for distributing the project work among your 3 team members.
> Who writes the client program, the server program, each module?
> Who is responsible for various aspects of testing, for documentation, etc?

## Server (main module)

### Data structures

All data structures are defined within the [Game](#game-module) module section.

### Definition of function prototypes

> For each function in server, here is a brief description and its function prototype.

Handles messages to `PLAY`, `SPECTATE`, or a specific `KEY` sent by a client. The function calls `inform_newClient` to allow new players to join the game if the maximum amount of player has not been reached, to ensure the most recent spectator is observing the game, and calls `handle_movement` for any key press.
```c
bool handleMessage(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
```


Sends a message to all players and the spectator to update their local displays by calling `send_displayMsg`.
```c
void update_displays(game_t* game);
```


Called by handleMessage when a client sends a `PLAY` or `SPECTATE` request. Sends client a gold message by calling `send_goldMsg` and a display message by calling `send_displayMsg`.
```c
void inform_newClient(client_t* client, game_t* game);
```


Called in `inform_newClient` and `handle_message`. Informs players of the amount of gold they pick up, the amount in their purses, and both players and spectators of the amount left in the game.
```c
void send_goldMsg(game_t* game, client_t* client, int goldPickedUp);
```


Called by `update_displays` to update an individual client's display.
```c
void send_displayMsg(game_t* game, client_t* client);
```


Extracts each player's name when they first join the game, storing the string up to a maximum of 50 characters.
```c
char* extract_playerName(const char* message, addr_t clientAddr);
```


Called by `handleMessage` to handle each request, or message, of a client playing the game.
```c
char* extractRequest(const char* input);
```


Called by `handleMessage` to handle the movement of a player whenever they press `Q` for quitting or a key for moving within the grid. When moving, the function updates a player's position, visibility, and handles the cases when a player steps on gold or another player.
```c
void handle_movement(client_t* player, char key, game_t* game);
```


Updates the previous spot occupies by a player when they move to the next spot.
```c
static void update_previous_spot(client_t* player, game_t* game, char grid_val);
```


Sends message to client about to quit the game. Called if a client hits `Q` on their keyboard, if the game ends by virtue of all gold being collected, if a new client tries to join the game when the maximum number of players has been reached, or if a new spectator joins the game.
```c
void send_quitMsg(addr_t clientAddr, int quitCode, bool isSpectator);
```

## Grid module

The functions in this helper module are utilized by the server.

### Data structures

All data structures are defined within the [Game](#game-module) module section.

### Definition of function prototypes

Reads a file into an array of strings, with each string in the array representing a row of the game map.
```c
char** load_grid(FILE* fp, int* rows, int* columns)
```


Loads an empty player grid of equal rows and columns as the global grid.
```c
char** load_player_grid(game_t* game)
```


Converts an array of strings to a string.
```c
char* grid_toStr(char** global_grid, char** player_grid, int rows, int columns)
```


Assigns a random spot for an object (used to randomly place players and gold).
```c
void assign_random_spot(char** grid, int rows, int columns, char thing, int* spot_r, int* spot_c)
```


Returns the symbol at given coordinates of a grid.
```c
char get_grid_value(game_t* game, int r, int c)
```


Assigns a new symbol at given coordinates of a grid.
```c
void change_spot(game_t* game, int r, int c, char symbol)
```


Checks whether a location is open for a player to move in.
```c
static bool isOpen(game_t* game, const int c, const int r)
```


Determines if a value is an integer.
```c
bool static is_integer(float num);
```


Computes whether a point on the grid is visible from a player's current location.
```c
bool is_visible(game_t* game, const int playerColumn, const int playerRow, const int column, const int row) 
```


Loops over each point in the grid and calls `is_visible`, updating the player's grid accordingly. Returns true if the player's grid was modified.
```c
bool get_player_visible(game_t* game, client_t* player)
```


Frees memory allocated to a grid.
```c
void grid_delete(char** grid, int rows)
```

### Detailed pseudo code

#### `load_grid`:

    check if file is valid
    while there are rows in the map file
        add row containing a string of the file to grid 2d character array


#### `load_player_grid`:

    initialize an empty row as a string containing "\0" at an index equal to the last global grid cloumn + 1

#### `grid_toStr`:

    initialize a string for the converted map
    for each row the grid
        for each column in the grid
            the map string at index (current_row * (columns + 1) + current_column) is assigned the value of grid[current_row][current_column]
            if the player's grid is not null
                the map string gets assigned the value of player's grid[current_row][current_column] (at the same index as above)
        add "\0"
    add "\0"
    return the string


#### `assign_random_spot`:

    return false


#### `is_integer`:

    return true if a floating point variable is equal to iself cast as an integer


#### `is_visible`:

    if no change in x (player on same column as spot)  
        move incrementally towards the spot (either up or down, depending on player location)
    if no change in y (player on same row as spot)
        move incrementally towards the spot (either left or right, depending on player location)
    if change in both x and y

                if it is not a valid grid point (".", "#", "*", or a letter)
                    return false
            else
                if the grid points above and below the point are not valid (".", "#", "*", or a letter)
                    return false 
        for each row between player and spot

    for each row in the player's grid
        for each column in the player's grid
            if player at point location
                update player grid
                update modified
            if point is visible
