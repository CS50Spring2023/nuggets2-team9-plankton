# CS50 Nuggets
## Implementation Spec
### Team 9: Plankton, 23S, 2023

According to the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the Nuggets game requires two standalone programs: a client and a server. As a team of 3, we designed and implemented the server program and used a predesigned client for testing.
Outside of server, our design also includes the `grid` module, which handles the client and global grids, and the `game` module, which handles initializing, updating, and ending the game.
We describe each program and module separately.
We do not describe the `support` library nor the modules that enable features that go beyond the spec.
We avoid repeating information that is provided in the requirements spec.

## Plan for division of labor

Jackson: design doc, server, game module, integration & testing

Sanjana: grid module, visibility, integration & testing, documentation

Andra: documentation (design, implementation, headers etc.), visibility

## Data structures

We defined three custom data structures within `structs.h`, which are utilized by the main module, `server`, as well as by the helper modules `grid` and `game`. Since our grid is represented as an array of strings (or a string), we decided a against creating a grid structure to avoid unnecessary complexity.

* `gold_location_t` holds coordiantes and gold count for bundles of gold. The `game` module uses it to handle loading gold piles at the beginning of the game and updating them throughout the game.

* `client_t` holds all necessary information about each client who joins the game, including their address, position, personalized grid, and amount of gold, if they are a player. This structure is heavily utilized by all three modules.

* `game_t` holds all high level information about the game, including the global grid, a list of all the clients, and the amount of gold remaining in the grid. This structure is heavily utilized by all three modules.


## Server (main module)

### Definition of function prototypes

> For each function in server, here is a brief description and its function prototype.

Handles messages to `PLAY`, `SPECTATE`, or a specific `KEY` sent by a client. The function calls `inform_newClient` to allow new players to join the game if the maximum amount of player has not been reached, to ensure the most recent spectator is observing the game, and calls `handle_movement` for any key press.
```c
bool handleMessage(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
```

Sends a message to all players and the spectator to update their local displays by calling `send_displayMsg`.
```c
void update_displays(game_t* game);
```

Called by handleMessage when a client sends a `PLAY` or `SPECTATE` request. Sends client a gold message by calling `send_goldMsg` and a display message by calling `send_displayMsg`.
```c
void inform_newClient(client_t* client, game_t* game);
```

Called in `inform_newClient` and `handle_message`. Informs players of the amount of gold they pick up, the amount in their purses, and both players and spectators of the amount left in the game.
```c
void send_goldMsg(game_t* game, client_t* client, int goldPickedUp);
```

Called by `update_displays` to update an individual client's display.
```c
void send_displayMsg(game_t* game, client_t* client);
```

Extracts each player's name when they first join the game, storing the string up to a maximum of 50 characters.
```c
char* extract_playerName(const char* message, addr_t clientAddr);
```

Called by `handleMessage` to handle each request, or message, of a client playing the game.
```c
char* extractRequest(const char* input);
```

Called by `handleMessage` to handle the movement of a player whenever they press `Q` for quitting or a key for moving within the grid. When moving, the function updates a player's position, visibility, and handles the cases when a player steps on gold or another player.
```c
void handle_movement(client_t* player, char key, game_t* game);
```

Updates the previous spot occupies by a player when they move to the next spot.
```c
static void update_previous_spot(client_t* player, game_t* game, char grid_val);
```

Sends message to client about to quit the game. Called if a client hits `Q` on their keyboard, if the game ends by virtue of all gold being collected, if a new client tries to join the game when the maximum number of players has been reached, or if a new spectator joins the game.
```c
void send_quitMsg(addr_t clientAddr, int quitCode, bool isSpectator);
```

### Data structures

All data structures are defined within the [Game](#game-module) module section.

```c
char** load_grid(FILE* fp, int* rows, int* columns)
```

```c
char** load_player_grid(game_t* game)
```

## Testing plan

### unit testing

We will first ensure that all modules compile separately. We will create a unit test for the grid module, testing loading in a map file and the functions in the grid module. We will also create a unit test for the server to ensure that it can send and receive messages to and from clients. Since the game module's function is to initialize, update, and end the game, we will test it in integration with the server.

### integration testing

As a team of three, we will test the integration of the server with our custom helper modules. We will test that game properly initializes, updates, and ends the game when the respective messages are received by the server. We will also test grid integration by observing whether a client's and spectator's (global) grids update as expected for specific player moves, in terms of visibility, symbols, and game statistics present on the grid displays. We will also test the functioning of the game on a custom grid we created, `plankton.txt`.
