# CS50 Nuggets
## Design Spec
### Plankton, Spring, 2023

> This **template** includes some gray text meant to explain how to use the template; delete all of them in your document!

According to the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the Nuggets game requires two standalone programs: a client and a server. Since our team has 3 people, we will not be describing or completing the client proggram
Our design also includes x, y, z modules.
We describe each program and module separately.
We do not describe the `support` library nor the modules that enable features that go beyond the spec.
We avoid repeating information that is provided in the requirements spec.

## Server
### User interface

See the requirements spec for the command-line interface.
There is no interaction with the user: the server receives input through messages from the client.

### Inputs and outputs

> Briefly describe the inputs (map file) and outputs (to terminal).
> If you write to log files, or log to stderr, describe that here.
> Command-line arguments are not 'input'.

### Functional decomposition into modules

> List and briefly describe any modules that comprise your server, other than the main module.

### Pseudo code for logic/algorithmic flow

> For each function write pseudocode indented by a tab, which in Markdown will cause it to be rendered in literal form (like a code block).
> Much easier than writing as a bulleted list!
> For example:

The server will run as follows:

	execute from a command line per the requirement spec
	parse the command line, validate parameters
	call initializeGame() to set up data structures
	initialize the 'message' module
	print the port number on which we wait
	load grid 
	load gold
	call message_loop(), to await clients
		load a player for each client
		for each message after a player has been initialized
			handle the message by calling handleMove
	call gameOver() to inform all clients the game has ended
	clean up


> Then briefly describe each of the major functions, perhaps with level-4 #### headers.

### Major data structures

> Describe each major data structure in this program: what information does it represent, how does it represent the data, and what are its members.
> This description should be independent of the programming language.
> Mention, but do not describe, data structures implemented by other modules (such as the new modules you detail below, or any libcs50 data structures you plan to use).

## Grid Module

### The Grid Module will be a collection of helper functions to be utilized in the server, it will not have a unique main or algorithmic flow.

### Functional decomposition

* loadVisible:
	For a given player, load what points are currently visible to them
* loadGold:
	During the initialization of the game, randomly load the gold into valid coordinates (accessible to players)
* addPlayer:
	When a player enters the game, randomly add them into a valid spot (accessible to players, doesn't currently contain gold)
* handleMove:
	Given the coordinate a player is attempting to move to, determine if they're allowed to. If so, allow them to move, if there's gold, handle that accordingly (update player struct and global game status). If there's another player there, handle that accordingly. Then, update the game accordingly.
* updateGame:
	Has helper functions updateGold, updateVisibility, and updateSeen

### Pseudo code for each Function

> For any non-trivial function, add a level-4 #### header and provide tab-indented pseudocode.
> This pseudocode should be independent of the programming language.

### Major data structures

* Player Struct that contains the following
	* What coordinates the player has "seen" [represented as an array of tuples]
	* What coordinates the player currently can see [represented as an array of tuples]
	* How much gold the player has [represented as an int]

* Grid Struct that contains the following
	* NR x NC array that contains numeric values for each coordinate, denoting what is located there
	* -1 = this gridspot can never be accessed by the player (ex: empty space between rooms)
	* . = this gridspot is empty, it can be accessed by the player, but contains nothing
	* * = this gridspot contains gold
	* x = this gridspot is a corner
	* p = this gridspot contains a player
	* | = this gridspot contains a vertical wall, it cannot be accessed
	* - = this gridspot contains a horizontal wall, it cannot be accessed

> Describe each major data structure in this module: what information does it represent, how does it represent the data, and what are its members.
> This description should be independent of the programming language.
